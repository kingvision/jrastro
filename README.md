JRastro
=======

JRastro is a tracing library for Java applications based on the JVMTI
interface. The library is released under GPLv3, and requires
[librastro](https://github.com/schnorr/akypuera/tree/master/librastro)
to provide a low memory footprint and low intrusion. The binary trace
files are converted to the Paje file format using the tool called
`jrastro_converter`.

Compiling
---------

    $ git clone git@github.com:schnorr/jrastro.git
    $ mkdir jrastro/build ; cd build
    $ cmake -DRASTRO_PATH:PATH=/usr/local/ ..
    $ make


Using
-----

JRastro is a JVMTI agent, so you can invoke it as you'll do for any
other JVMTI agent. Here's a way to do it:

   $ java -agentpath:/path/to/your/libjrastro.so YourJavaApplication

You have four environment variables that you need to set before
launching your application with the JRastro agent:

* JRST_THREAD_TRACING
* JRST_METHOD_TRACING
* JRST_MONITOR_TRACING
* JRST_GC_TRACING

The agent will create a trace file for each thread present in your
application. A run with three threads generate this list of files:

    rastro-0-0.rst
    rastro-1-0.rst
    rastro-2-0.rst

jrastro_converter
-----------------

Trace files created with JRastro are converted to the [Paje generic
format](http://paje.sf.net) using the `jrastro_converter`, passing as
parameter __all the rst__ files generated by the mpi execution.  The
corresponding paje trace file is printed on __stdout__.

    $ jrastro_converter rastro*.rst
